AutoEncoder For Movie Recommendation Based on TensorFlow
===

#### An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner.The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction.
