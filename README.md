Movie Topic Modeling based on NLP and Recommendation System Design	04/2018, Los Angeles, CA
♦	Used tokenizing, stemming and stop-words removing to preprocess user review text, and extracted features via TF-IDF 
♦	Trained unsupervised learning models including K-Means Clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation to implement Latent Topic Clustering; visualized clustering results by dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis.
♦	Implemented Collaborative Filtering Model on Spark and Autoencoder Model on TensorFlow to provide personalized movie recommendation
